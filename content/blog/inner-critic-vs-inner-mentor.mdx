We've all heard that voice in our heads that continuously criticises, dismisses, and judges us.
I was no different; until I read and practiced the book, Playing Big, by Tara Mohr.

We set a three-month target for finishing this book. But, after three weeks, I'm already near the end of the book. That's how wonderfully this book has captured my attention and interest.
The subtitle of this book reads,

>  For Women Who Want to Speak Up, Stand Out and Lead. 

I agree that this book will appeal to a wide range of women. However, many men will be able to perceive a reflection of their own mental feelings when they read Chapters 1 and 2.

Our inner critic may be a vicious and destructive force. Its power and influence define our overall mental health. The destructive voice in our mind is never satisfied and may taint and ruin whatever we do, no matter how spectacular.
