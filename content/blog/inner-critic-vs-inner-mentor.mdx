"youâ€™re not good enough", "you're not ready yet", "you do not belong here",
"dont speak up now. You will say something stupid! ". We've all heard that voice
in our heads that continuously criticises, dismisses, and judges us. I was no
different; until I read and practiced the book,
[Playing Big, by Tara Mohr](https://amzn.to/3cvmhol) .

We set a three-month target for finishing [this book](https://amzn.to/3cvmhol).
But, after three weeks, I'm already near the end of the book. That's how
wonderfully this book has captured my attention and interest. The subtitle of
this book reads,

> For Women Who Want to Speak Up, Stand Out and Lead.

I agree that this book will appeal to a wide range of women. However, many men
will be able to perceive a reflection of their own mental feelings when they
read Chapters 1 and 2.

Our inner critic may be a vicious and destructive force. Its power and influence
define our overall mental health. The destructive voice in our mind is never
satisfied and may taint and ruin whatever we do, no matter how spectacular.

## What is Inner Critic ?

According to Tara, the inner critic or the inner voice of "not me" has eleven
qualities. You wouldn't notice all eleven qualities when that voice of
self-doubt speaks to you, but you will notice at least a few. My continuous
observation of my inner voice, who I named _Rocker_,has 3 qualities.

- Ostensibly, the voice of reason
- The voice of "You are not ready yet"
- The voice of "You aren't good at math/negotiating/technical stuff"

### The voice of reason
