We started a book club last month at my office. We have about 15 members in the club. The first book we picked up was, Playing Big, by Tara Mohr.
We have a quarter to finish reading this book. But 3 weeks in, I am already at the last chapter. That is how well this book has grabbed my time and interest. 
The subtitle of this book says

>  For Women Who Want to Speak Up, Stand Out and Lead. 

I agree that this book will resonate with a lot of women. But quite a lot of men will also be able to see a reflection of the mental emotions they themselves as they read Chapters 1 and 2.
