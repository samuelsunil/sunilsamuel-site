We all have workflows we go through regularly to get our job done. When we start
working we need to open a few applications, websites, and start a few servers.
When we commit code we want to make sure we didn't break tests or fail linting.

You could take time to automate all of this stuff, but is it really worth it? I
mean, how long does it take to open a few apps, copy/paste some skeleton code,
etc.? Let's say it takes 4 hours to automate creating all the files and things I
need for a new blog post (`index.mdx` with metadata content and optimized banner
image) — a task that takes about 60 seconds. I'd have to do that 240 times to
make it worth it, right?

I mean, after all, just look at these XKCD comics!
